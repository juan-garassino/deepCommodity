### Week 06 - Deep Learning - Day 4 - Predict `temperature`

* In this challenge, you will predict the temperature in the future based on:
    - the past values of the temperature (which is our target)
    - the past values of other weather features (which are called past covariates)

* This exercise is also designed to help you learn :
    - how to deal with a temporal dataset which is a single Time Series
    - how to cross-validate a Recurrent Neural Network creating folds
    - how to generate sequences from these folds to train your model on
